The first, ''You'll Never Get Rich'' (1941), catapulted Hayworth to stardom and provided Astaire his third on-screen opportunity to integrate Latin American dance idioms into his style (the first being with Ginger Rogers in "The Carioca" number from "Flying Down to Rio" (1933) and the second, again with Rogers, was the "Dengozo" dance from "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle" (1939)), taking advantage of Hayworth's professional Latin dance pedigree.
Astaire also appeared in the first two ''That's Entertainment!''
In the second, aged seventy-six, he performed song-and-dance routines with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film.
Frame for frame, the two performances are absolutely identical, down to the subtlest gesture.
Recently, film footage taken by Fred Stone of Astaire performing in ''Gay Divorce'' with Luce's successor, Dorothy Stone, in New York in 1933 was uncovered by dancer and historian Betsy Baytos and now represents the earliest known performance footage of Astaire.
Astaire received a percentage of the films' profits, something extremely rare in actors' contracts at that time.
The producer of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, Pandro S. Berman, claimed he had never heard the story in the 1930s and that it only emerged years afterwards.
''Royal Wedding'' (1951) with  Jane Powell proved to be very successful, but ''The Belle of New York'' (1952)  with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster.
By age 14, Fred had taken on the musical responsibilities for their act.
They would often start with a blank slate:
Beyond film and television, many noted dancers and choreographers, including Rudolf Nureyev, Sammy Davis, Jr., Michael Jackson, Gregory Hines, Mikhail Baryshnikov, George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Madhuri Dixit, also acknowledged his importance and influence.
Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success."
She couldn't tap and she couldn't do this and that&nbsp;... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along.
She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself."
His legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years.
The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.
''The Band Wagon'' (1953), which is considered to be one of the finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds.
In 1946 his horse Triplicate won the prestigious Hollywood Gold Cup and San Juan Capistrano Handicap.
Along with Bing Crosby, George Murphy, Ginger Rogers, and others, he was a charter (founding) member of the Hollywood Republican Committee.
Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M,  ''Silk Stockings'' (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office.
This episode marked the final time that he danced on screen.
He made two pictures with Rita Hayworth, the daughter of his former vaudeville dance idols, the Cansinos.
In 1912, Fred became an  Episcopalian.
Astaire was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Johanna "Ann" (née Geilus) and Frederic "Fritz" Austerlitz (born September 8, 1868 as Friedrich Emanuel Austerlitz).
Let's add the looks later.'
III'' shows the two performances side-by-side in split screen.
During 1952, Astaire recorded ''The Astaire Story'', a four-volume album with a quintet led by Oscar Peterson.
However, he was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the Astaire-Rogers pairing.
The family decided to take a two-year break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the Gerry Society and the child labor laws of the time.
Astaire won the Emmy for Best Single Performance by an Actor, but the choice had a controversial backlash because many believed that his dancing in the special was not the type of "acting" for which the award was designed.
After announcing his retirement in 1946, Astaire concentrated on his horse-racing interests and in 1947 founded the Fred Astaire Dance Studios, which he subsequently sold in 1966.
While ''Follies'' was a hit, ''Yolanda'' bombed at the box office and Astaire, ever insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter, surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of ''Blue Skies'' (1946), nominating "Puttin' on the Ritz" as his farewell dance.
Fred went on to achieve success on his own on Broadway and in London with ''Gay Divorce'' (later made into the film ''The Gay Divorcee''), while considering offers from Hollywood.
Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket.
His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing.
Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began&nbsp;... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.According to Astaire, "Ginger had never danced with a partner before ''Flying Down to Rio''.
Astaire's style of dance sequences, which allowed the viewer to follow the dancers and choreography in their entirety, clearly contrasted with the Busby Berkeley musicals, which were known for dance sequences filled with extravagant aerial shots, quick takes, and zooms on certain areas of the body, such as a chorus row of arms or legs.
Fred and Adele's mother suggested they change their name to "Astaire," as she felt "Austerlitz" sounded reminiscent of the name of a battle.
The album, produced by Norman Granz, provided a musical overview of Astaire's career.
Astaire later clarified, insisting that the report had actually read: "Can't act.
Astaire further observed:
Astaire appeared in non-dancing roles in three other films and several television series from 1957 to 1969.
Always immaculately turned out, he and Cary Grant were called "the best dressed actors in American movies".
Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas.
His second film with Hayworth, ''You Were Never Lovelier'' (1942), was equally successful and featured a duet to Kern's "I'm Old Fashioned," which became the centerpiece of Jerome Robbins's 1983 New York City Ballet tribute to Astaire.
Politically, Astaire was a conservative and a lifelong Republican Party supporter, though he never made his political views publicly known.
He returned to make two more films with Rogers, ''Carefree'' (1938) and ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle'' (1939).
Astaire's life has never been portrayed on film.
In 1978, he co-starred with Helen Hayes in a well received television film, ''A Family Upside Down,'' in which they played an elderly couple coping with failing health.
She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong."
The Astaires performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time too.
Astaire did not retire from dancing completely.
Free of the brother-sister constraints of the former pairing and working with new partner Claire Luce, Fred created a romantic partnered dance to Cole Porter's "Night and Day," which had been written for ''Gay Divorce''.
He made a well publicized guest appearance on the science-fiction television series ''Battlestar Galactica'' in 1979, as Chameleon, the possible father of Starbuck, in "The Man with Nine Lives," a role written for him by Donald P. Bellisario.
According to Hollywood folklore, a screen test report on Astaire for RKO Radio Pictures, now lost along with the test, is reported to have read: "Can't sing.
The career of the Astaire siblings resumed with mixed fortunes, though with increasing skill and polish, as they began to incorporate tap dancing into their routines.
Some sources state that the Astaire siblings appeared in a 1915 film titled ''Fanchon, the Cricket'', starring Mary Pickford, but the Astaires have consistently denied this.
Their first act was called ''Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty''.
Astaire's second innovation involved the context of the dance; he was adamant that all song and dance routines be seamlessly integrated into the plotlines of the film.
Astaire's last major musical film was ''Finian's Rainbow'' (1968), directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
The former film is particularly remembered for his virtuoso solo dance to "Let's Say it with Firecrackers" while the latter film featured an innovative song and dance routine to a song indelibly associated with him: "Puttin' on the Ritz."
She faked it an awful lot.
The restoration won a technical Emmy in 1988 for Ed Reitan, Don Kent, and Dan Einstein, who restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage.
Astaire also co-introduced a number of song classics via song duets with his partners.
His next partner, Lucille Bremer, was featured in two lavish vehicles, both directed by Vincente Minnelli: the fantasy ''Yolanda and the Thief'', which featured an avant-garde surrealistic ballet, and the musical revue ''Ziegfeld Follies'' (1946), which featured a memorable teaming of Astaire with Gene Kelly to "The Babbit and the Bromide," a Gershwin song Astaire had introduced with his sister Adele back in 1927.
Astaire was still unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership, however.
Astaire famously quipped: "Either the camera will dance, or I will."
Fred, Jr. (born January 21, 1936), appeared with his father in the movie ''Midas Run'' but became a charter pilot and rancher instead of an actor.
Phyllis's death from lung cancer, at the age of 46, ended 21 years of a blissful marriage and left Astaire devastated.
Astaire continued to act in the 1970s, appearing on television as the father of Robert Wagner's character, Alexander Mundy, in ''It Takes a Thief'' and in such films as ''The Towering Inferno'' (1974), in which he danced with Jennifer Jones and for which he received his only Academy Award nomination, in the category of Best Supporting Actor.
In his autobiography ''Steps in Time'', Astaire remarked, "She 'put 'em down like a man,' no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie.
His final film role was the 1981 adaptation of Peter Straub's novel ''Ghost Story''.
Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists.
Their partnership elevated them both to stardom; as Katharine Hepburn reportedly said, "He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal."
As Vincente Minnelli stated, "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of all the people in the world.
As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years.
Astaire won an Emmy Award for his performance.
However, this did not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending him for a few days to MGM in 1933 for his significant Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film ''Dancing Lady''.
Still it's never as bad as I think it is."
He voiced the mailman narrator in the 1970s animated television specials ''Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town'' and ''The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town''.
At one point Astaire offered to return the award, but the Television Academy refused to consider it.
Although Astaire refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister's steps and took up piano, accordion, and clarinet.
Astaire was also given complete autonomy over how the dances would be presented, allowing him to revolutionize dance on film.
He always thinks he is no good."
When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music.
He will not even go to see his rushes...
When ''Daddy Long Legs'' was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office.
The first of these programs, 1958's ''An Evening with Fred Astaire'', won nine Emmy Awards, including "Best Single Performance by an Actor" and "Most Outstanding Single Program of the Year."
He negotiated with RKO to strike out on his own with ''A Damsel in Distress'' in 1937 with an inexperienced, non-dancing Joan Fontaine, unsuccessfully as it turned out.
Although he possessed a light voice, he was admired for his lyricism, diction, and phrasing—the grace and elegance so prized in his dancing seemed to be reflected in his singing, a capacity for synthesis which led Burton Lane to describe him as "the world's greatest musical performer."
Astaire shed his white tie and tails to play an Irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold in the shadows of Fort Knox the gold will multiply.
Other partners during this period included Paulette Goddard in ''Second Chorus'' (1940), in which he dance-conducted the Artie Shaw orchestra.
The film was a box-office failure, but has gained a strong reputation over the years.
With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs.
He next appeared opposite the seventeen-year-old Joan Leslie in the wartime drama ''The Sky's the Limit'' (1943), where he introduced Arlen and Mercer's "One for My Baby" while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine.
For her part, Rogers described Astaire's uncompromising standards extending to the whole production: "Sometimes he'll think of a new line of dialogue or a new angle for the story&nbsp;... they never know what time of night he'll call up and start ranting enthusiastically about a fresh idea&nbsp;... No loafing on the job on an Astaire picture, and no cutting corners."
His stage and subsequent film and television careers spanned a total of 76 years, during which he made 31 musical films and several award-winning television specials and issued numerous recordings.
While both films earned respectable gross incomes, they both lost money because of increased production costs, and Astaire left RKO, after being labeled "box office poison" by the ''Independent Film Journal''.
They would spend weeks creating all the dance sequences in a secluded rehearsal space before filming would begin, working with a rehearsal pianist (often the composer Hal Borne) who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators.
Typically, an Astaire picture would include at least three standard dances: a solo performance by Astaire—which he termed his "sock solo", a partnered comedy dance routine, and a partnered romantic dance routine.
For example, with his sister Adele, he co-introduced the Gershwins' "I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise" from ''Stop Flirting'' (1923), "Fascinating Rhythm" in ''Lady, Be Good'' (1924), "Funny Face" in ''Funny Face'' (1927); and, in duets with Ginger Rogers, he presented Irving Berlin's "I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket" in ''Follow the Fleet'' (1936), Jerome Kern's "Pick Yourself Up" and "A Fine Romance" in ''Swing Time'' (1936), along with The Gershwins' "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off" from ''Shall We Dance'' (1937).
Astaire attempted to drop out of the film ''Daddy Long Legs'' (1955), which he was in the process of filming, offering to pay the production costs to date, but was persuaded to stay.
Astaire asked his agent to obtain a role for him on ''Galactica'' because of his grandchildren's interest in the series.
At age seventy-eight, he broke his left wrist while riding his grandson's skateboard.
Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - ''Three Little Words'' with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton and one on loan-out to Paramount - ''Let's Dance'' with Betty Hutton.
He remained physically active well into his eighties.
Instead of using dance as spectacle as Busby Berkeley did, Astaire used it to move the plot along.
Astaire's mother was born in the United States to Lutheran German immigrants from East Prussia and Alsace.
Six out of the nine Astaire-Rogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for RKO; all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time.
He'd say, 'Let's do the steps.
Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators and, unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with Hermes Pan, he tapped the talents of other choreographers in an effort to continually innovate.
Mueller sums up Rogers's abilities as follows:
Michael Kidd, who choreographed the 1953 film ''The Band Wagon'', found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by Astaire.
He termed his eclectic approach his "outlaw style," an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry.
While ''Three Little Words'' did quite well at the box office, ''Let's Dance'' was a financial disappointment.
Frequently, a dance sequence was built around two or three principal ideas, sometimes inspired by his own steps or by the music itself, suggesting a particular mood or action.
And while George Gershwin was somewhat critical of Astaire's singing abilities, he wrote many of his most memorable songs for him.
Astaire died from pneumonia on June 22, 1987, at the age of 88.
Astaire maintained this policy from ''The Gay Divorcee'' in 1934 onwards until his last film musical, ''Finian's Rainbow'', made in 1968, when he was overruled by director Francis Ford Coppola.
As a result of their father's salesmanship, Fred and Adele rapidly landed a major contract and played the famed Orpheum Circuit in the Midwest, Western and some Southern cities in the United States.
Astaire's execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision.
Irving Berlin considered Astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs—"as good as Jolson, Crosby or Sinatra, not necessarily because of his voice, but for his conception of projecting a song."
documentaries, in the mid 1970s.
But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release.
Astaire was married for the first time in 1933, to the 25-year-old Phyllis Potter (formerly Phyllis Livingston Baker; born 1908, died September 13, 1954), a Boston-born New York socialite and former wife of Eliphalet Nott Potter III (1906–1981), after pursuing her ardently for roughly two years, and despite the objections of his mother and sister.
The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with ''Over the Top'', a patriotic revue.
It was also noteworthy for being the first major broadcast to be prerecorded on color videotape and has recently been restored.
The local paper wrote, "the Astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville."
In a review, ''Variety'' magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of ''Flying Down to Rio'' is the screen promise of Fred Astaire&nbsp;...
The end of the partnership was traumatic for Astaire but stimulated him to expand his range.
Despite Adele and Fred's teasing rivalry, they quickly acknowledged their individual strengths, his durability and her greater talent.
In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, ''Daddy Long Legs'' (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century Fox, when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer.
After arriving in New York City at age 24 on October 26, 1892, and being inspected at Ellis Island, Astaire's father, hoping to find work in his brewing trade, moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and landed a job with the Storz Brewing Company.
He drew from a variety of influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged.
This film, which was choreographed by Astaire alone and achieved modest box office success, represented an important departure for Astaire from his usual charming happy-go-lucky screen persona and confused contemporary critics.
Performances with *Ginger Rogers (10), **Rita Hayworth (2), ***Bing Crosby (2), ****Vera-Ellen (2), *****Cyd Charisse (2)
Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production.
Their daughter Ava Astaire (born March 19, 1942; married Richard McKenzie) remains actively involved in promoting her late father's heritage.
Astaire's mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by virtue of her children's talents, after Astaire's sister, Adele Astaire, early on revealed herself to be an instinctive dancer and singer.
In 1939, Astaire left RKO to freelance and pursue new film opportunities, with mixed though generally successful outcomes.
In his heyday, Astaire was referenced in lyrics of songwriters Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart and Eric Maschwitz and continues to inspire modern songwriters.
He first presented Jerome Kern's "The Way You Look Tonight" in ''Swing Time'' (1936); the Gershwins' "They Can't Take That Away From Me" in ''Shall We Dance'' (1937), "A Foggy Day" and "Nice Work if You Can Get it" in ''A Damsel in Distress'' (1937); Johnny Mercer's "One for My Baby" from ''The Sky's the Limit'' (1943) and "Something's Gotta Give" from ''Daddy Long Legs'' (1955); and Harry Warren and Arthur Freed's "This Heart of Mine" from ''Ziegfeld Follies'' (1946).
The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.
Many of his dances were built around a "gimmick," such as dancing on the walls in "Royal Wedding" or dancing with his shadows in ''Swing Time'', that he or his collaborator had thought up earlier and saved for the right situation.
The goofy act debuted in Keyport, New Jersey, in a "tryout theater."
The 1994 documentary ''That's Entertainment!
One last request of his was to thank his fans for their years of support.
However, he soon returned to the big screen to replace the injured Kelly in ''Easter Parade'' (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949).
Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work.
From vaudeville dancer Aurelio Coccia, they learned the tango, waltz, and other ballroom dances popularized by Vernon and Irene Castle.
They split in 1932 when Adele married her first husband, Lord Charles Cavendish, second son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire.
With Judy Garland, he sang Irving Berlin's "A Couple of Swells" from ''Easter Parade'' (1948); and, with Jack Buchanan, Oscar Levant, and Nanette Fabray he delivered Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz's "That's Entertainment" from ''The Band Wagon'' (1953).
He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains in a class by himself.
He first met George Gershwin, who was working as a song plugger for Jerome H. Remick's music publishing company, in 1916.
Astaire was reunited with Rogers in 1949 at MGM for their final outing, ''The Barkleys of Broadway'', the only one of their films together to be shot in Technicolor.
He recorded his own "It's Just Like Taking Candy from a Baby" with Benny Goodman in 1940 and nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a successful popular song composer.
His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced.
The success of the stage play was credited to this number and, when recreated in ''The Gay Divorcee'' (1934), the film version of the play, it ushered in a new era in filmed dance.
She made everything work for her.
In any case, the test was clearly disappointing, and David&nbsp;O. Selznick, who had signed Astaire to RKO and commissioned the test, stated in a memo, "I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test."
When their father suddenly lost his job, the family moved to New York City in 1905 to launch the show business career of the children, who began training at the Alviene Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts.
He was churchgoing, supportive of American military action, and dismissive of the increasing open sexuality in movies of the 1970s.
Gene Kelly, another major innovator in filmed dance, said that "the history of dance on film begins with Astaire."
Astaire remained a male fashion icon even into his later years, eschewing his trademark top hat, white tie, and tails (for which he never really cared) in favor of a breezy casual style of tailored sports jackets, colored shirts, cravats, and slacks—the latter usually held up by the idiosyncratic use of an old tie or silk scarf in place of a belt.
His first post-Ginger dance partner was the redoubtable Eleanor Powell—considered the finest female tap-dancer of her generation—in ''Broadway Melody of 1940'' where they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine."
Astaire was always on the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection.
Fred Astaire played Dr. Seamus Scully in the French film ''The Purple Taxi'' (1977).
In addition to Phyllis Potter's son, Eliphalet IV (known as Peter), the Astaires had two children.
Afterwards, Astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in film to concentrate on dramatic acting, scoring rave reviews for the nuclear war drama ''On the Beach'' (1959).
As a dancer, he is best remembered for his sense of rhythm, his legendary perfectionism, and as the dancing partner and on-screen romantic interest of Ginger Rogers, with whom he co-starred in a series of ten Hollywood musicals which transformed the genre.
Soon Adele grew to at least three inches taller than Fred and the pair began to look incongruous.
In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, ''Attitude Dancing'', ''They Can't Take These Away from Me'', and ''A Couple of Song and Dance Men'', the last an album of duets with Bing Crosby.
He always refused permission for such portrayals, saying, "However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell."
Kidd later recounted: "Technique was important to him.
In 1976, Astaire played a supporting role, as a dog owner, in the cult movie ''The Amazing Dobermans'', co-starring Barbara Eden and James Franciscus.
Extremely modest about his singing abilities (he frequently claimed that he could not sing, but the critics rated him as among the finest), Astaire introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the Great American Songbook, in particular, Cole Porter's: "Night and Day" in ''The Gay Divorcee'' (1932) and "So Near and Yet So Far" in ''You'll Never Get Rich'' (1941), Irving Berlin's "Isn't This a Lovely Day?
Film critic Pauline Kael adopts a more neutral stance, while ''Time'' magazine film critic Richard Schickel writes "The nostalgia surrounding Rogers-Astaire tends to bleach out other partners."
Astaire and Rogers made nine films together, including ''The Gay Divorcee'' (1934), ''Roberta'' (1935), ''Top Hat'' (1935), ''Follow the Fleet'' (1936), ''Swing Time'' (1936), ''Shall We Dance'' (1937), and ''Carefree'' (1938).
Astaire was a songwriter of note himself, with "I'm Building Up to an Awful Letdown"  (written with lyricist Johnny Mercer) reaching number four in the Hit Parade of 1936.
They were taught dance, speaking, and singing in preparation for developing an act.
Astaire was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fifth greatest male star of Classic Hollywood cinema in 100 Years... 100 Stars.
Family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed "L'Astaire."
With very few exceptions, Astaire created his routines in collaboration with other choreographers, primarily Hermes Pan.
On June 24, 1980, he was married again, to Robyn Smith (born August 14, 1944), a jockey 45 years his junior, who rode for Alfred G. Vanderbilt II and was herself on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' on July 31, 1972.
He wrote his agent, "I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!'
He played alongside Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn'' (1942) and later ''Blue Skies'' (1946) but, in spite of the enormous financial success of both, was reportedly dissatisfied with roles where he lost the girl to Crosby.
I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't want to be bothered with any more."
Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, "It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be."
Astaire was a lifelong golf and Thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast.
On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle ''Flying Down to Rio''.
Can dance a little."
As Astaire himself observed, "I've never yet got anything 100% right.
Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able to convey light-hearted venturesomeness or deep emotion when called for.
", "Cheek to Cheek" and "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails" in ''Top Hat'' (1935), "Let's Face the Music and Dance" in ''Follow the Fleet'' (1936) and "Change Partners" in ''Carefree'' (1938).
Luce stated that she had to encourage him to take a more romantic approach: "Come on, Fred, I'm not your sister, you know."
Astaire's father was born in Linz, Austria, to Jewish parents who had converted to Roman Catholicism.
His perfectionism was legendary; however, his relentless insistence on rehearsals and retakes was a burden to some.
He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said she was worried about dancing with him.
She planned a "brother and sister act," which was common in vaudeville at the time.
As Jerome Robbins stated, "Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive."
