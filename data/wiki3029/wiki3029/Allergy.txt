Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, ''Toxoplasma gondii'', and ''Helicobacter pylori'' (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma.
Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell.
Allergen immunotherapy is useful for environmental allergies, allergies to insect bites, and asthma.
Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.

Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed, in order to improve health and quality of life.
Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells.
The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.

Except for testing food and medication allergies, challenges are rarely performed.
Since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response.
The authors concluded that, based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatments.
The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.
This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages to the initial site.
The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine.
