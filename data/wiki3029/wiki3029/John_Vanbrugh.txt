In a letter dated 10 March 1740, the German Jacob Friedrich, Baron Bielfeld had this to say about Vanbrugh:
Critics of Restoration comedy are unanimous in declaring Lord Foppington "the greatest of all Restoration fops" (Dobrée), by virtue of being not merely laughably affected, but also "brutal, evil, and smart" (Hume ).
This is part of the furtive quality of the baroque of Seaton Delaval: the ornamental appears as a display of strength and mass.
The massing of the stone, the colonnades of the flanking wings, the heavy stonework and intricate recesses all create light and shade which is ornament in itself.
The often repeated rumour that the acoustics of the building Vanbrugh had designed were bad is exaggerated (see Milhous ), but the more practical Congreve had become anxious to extricate himself from the project, and Vanbrugh was left spreading himself extremely thin, running a theatre and simultaneously overseeing the building of Blenheim, a project which after June 1705 often took him out of town.
Designs varied and evolved until 1702, the pair working together.
In his fifth Royal Academy lecture of 1810, Sir John Soane said that 'By studying his works the artist will acquire a bold flight of irregular fancy', calling him 'the Shakespeare of architects'.
Secret groups tend to be poorly documented, and this sketch of the pre-history of the Club cannot be proved.
They are indeed mere models of houses, but notwithstanding their confined situation,  there are everywhere traces of a master to be discovered in their execution.
But if we consider that Sir John Vanbrugh was to construct a building of endless duration, that no bounds were set to expense, and that an edifice was required that should strike with awe and surprise even at a distance; the architect may be excused for having sacrificed, in some degree, the elegance of design to multiplicity of ornament.
Backed up by Cibber's own uninhibited performance, Sir Novelty delighted the audiences.
The premise of the plot, that a wife trapped in an abusive marriage might consider either leaving it or taking a lover, outraged some sections of Restoration society.
As at Blenheim, the central block is dominated by the raised clerestory of the great hall, adding to the drama of the building's silhouette, but unlike Vanbrugh's other great houses, no statuary decorates the roof-scape here.
The entrance front, on the southwest, has a centre containing six Corinthian pilasters, with those at each side paired to produce three bays, each of which contains a round arched window.
'''Sequel: ''The Relapse'''''
As the palace is still treated as an important part of English heritage, it became a World heritage site in 1987.
After Vanbrugh's death Abel Evans suggested this as his epitaph:
''Lie heavy on him, Earth!
The United Company had lost all its senior performers, and had great difficulty in finding and keeping actors of sufficient skills for the large cast required by ''The Relapse''.
Though Vanbrugh is best known in connection with stately houses, the parlous state of London's 18th century streets did not escape his attention.
These ties reveal the decidedly Protestant and sometimes radical milieu out of which Vanbrugh's own political opinions came.
Already discouraged and upset by the reception the palace was receiving from the Whig factions, the final blow for Vanbrugh came when the Duke was incapacitated in 1717 by a severe stroke, and the thrifty (and hostile) Duchess took control.
The often-repeated claim that Vanbrugh wrote part of his comedy ''The Provoked Wife'' in the Bastille is based on allusions in a couple of much later memoirs and is regarded with some doubt by modern scholars (see McCormick).
The interior would have been virtually complete by 1719, when the design for inlay on the stair landings was drawn up.
The arcade formed by linking the chimneys, which rises above the roof, is a notable external feature of the building,reminiscent of the belvederes of Blenheim Palace and producing a 'castle air'.18 It is square in shape and open on the northeast.
This error provided the get-out clause for the state when the costs and political infighting escalated.
''Dead Sir John Vanbrugh's house of clay''.
Vast effect, movement in staircases &c. good effect of long passages on entering.'
In 1703, he was appointed commissioner of Greenwich Hospital, which was under construction at this time, and succeeded Wren as the official architect (or Surveyor), while Hawksmoor was appointed Site Architect.
Cosy, middle class comfort was not the intention at Versailles, the great palace of Marlborough's foe, and it was certainly not deemed a consideration in the palace built to house the conqueror of Versailles' master.
On the northeast the wall was moved forward during nineteenth-century remodelling, destroying an aesthetically significant alignment between wall projections and the break in the roof arcade, which had been present in Vanbrugh's design.
A possible inspiration for Castle Howard was also Vaux-le-Vicomte in France
It was intended for the use of an actors' cooperative (see ''The Provoked Wife'' below) and hoped to improve the chances of legitimate theatre in London.
Four of Vanbrugh's designs act as milestones for evaluating this process:
The result was one of Vanbrugh's smaller houses.
His married life, however, was mostly spent at Greenwich (then not considered part of London at all) in the house on Maze Hill now known as Vanbrugh Castle, a miniature Scottish tower house designed by Vanbrugh in the earliest stages of his career.
The pageantry of state occasions appealed to his theatrical sense, his duties were not difficult, and he appears to have performed them well.
The house had 7 bays in its elevation, the central three are rusticated and the two outer bays only project on the ground floor.
Downes suggests, however, that the Club's origins go back to before the Glorious Revolution of 1689 and that its political importance was much greater before it went public in 1700, in calmer and more Whiggish times.
More often than not his work was a rebuild or remodel, such as that of Kimbolton Castle, where Vanbrugh had to follow the instructions of his patron.
On the 18th century stage, Vanbrugh's ''Relapse'' and ''Provoked Wife'' were only considered possible to perform in bowdlerised versions, but as such, they remained popular.
# Seaton Delaval Hall, begun in 1718.
Returning from bringing William messages at The Hague, Vanbrugh was arrested at Calais on a charge of espionage (which Downes concludes was trumped-up) in September 1688, two months before William invaded England.
Unsurprisingly under these circumstances, Vanbrugh's management of the Queen's Theatre in Haymarket showed "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgment".
He thus demonstrates an intense early identification with the Whig cause of parliamentary democracy, with which he was to remain affiliated all his life.
# Castle Howard, commissioned in 1699;
While the greater part of Castle Howard was inhabited and completed by 1709, the finishing touches were to continue for much of Vanbrugh's lifetime.
After the Duchess's final argument with the Queen in 1712, all state money ceased and work came to a halt.
Vanbrugh's prompt success as an architect can be attributed to his friendships with the influential of the day.
They also gave him a very wide social network that would play a role in all sections of his career: architectural, ceremonial, dramatic, military, political, and social.
His inexperience was compensated for by his unerring eye for perspective and detail and his close working relationship with Nicholas Hawksmoor.
Theatre was under threat from more colourful types of entertainment such as opera, juggling, pantomime (introduced by John Rich), animal acts, travelling dance troupes, and famous visiting Italian singers.
by this stage in his architectural career Vanbrugh was a master of baroque, he had taken this form of architecture not only beyond the flamboyant continental baroque of Castle Howard, but also past the more severe but still decorated Blenheim.
The unfinished manuscript, today available in Vanbrugh's ''Collected Works'', depicts a country family travelling to London and falling prey to its sharpers and temptations, while a London wife drives her patient husband to despair with her gambling and her consorting with the demi-monde of con men and half-pay officers.
Bristol is the only UK city outside London to possess buildings designed by Vanbrugh.
"This play (the ''Relapse'')", writes Cibber in his autobiography forty years later, "from its new and easy Turn of Wit, had great Success".
To dispel the myth of Vanbrugh's ''low origins'', Downes took pains to explore Vanbrugh's background, closely examining the family and connexions of each of his four grandparents: Vanbrugh, Jacobs or Jacobson, Carleton, and Croft, summing up the characteristics of each line and concluding that, far from being of lower middle class origins, Vanbrugh was descended from Anglo-Flemish or Netherlandish Protestant merchants who settled in London in the 16th and 17th centuries, minor courtiers, and country gentry.
Sir Robert Smirke was less complimentary 'Heaviness was the lightest of (Vanbrugh's) faults...
Vanbrugh's small but conspicuous final changes to the nearly completed building were considered a fine interpretation of Wren's original plans and intentions.
The stone, which was quarried on the site, was originally ochre in colour but has weathered to an orange-pink.
Marlborough's reward, from a grateful nation, was to be a splendid country seat, and the Duke himself chose fellow Kit-Cat John Vanbrugh to be the architect.
The rustic stonework is used for the entire facade, including on the entrance facade, the pairs of twin columns supporting little more than a stone cornice.
When we behold it a distance, it appears not as a single palace, but as an entire city.
The vulgar critic finds too many columns and ornaments; but the true connoisseur sees that all these ornaments are accompanied with utility, and that an inventive genius is visible in every part.
Throughout the Georgian period reaction to Vanbrugh's architecture varied.
The great arched gates and the huge solid portico were ornament in themselves, and the whole mass was considered rather than each facade.
Even so in August 1686 he left this position when the regiment was ordered to help garrison Guernsey.
Unlike that of the rake heroes and fops of his plays, Vanbrugh's personal life was without scandal.
''You have your end Madam, for I will never trouble you more Unless the Duke of Marlborough recovers so far, to shelter me from such intolerable Treatment.''
His influence on successive architects is incalculable.
They also hoped to make a profit, and Vanbrugh optimistically bought up the actors' company, making himself sole owner.
The gate, its tapering walls creating an illusion of greater height, also serves as water tower for the palace, thus confounding those of Vanbrugh's critics, such as the Duchess, who accused him of impracticability.
He had put a lot of money, his own and borrowed, into the theatre company, which he was never to recover.
Vanbrugh remained in prison in France for four and a half years, albeit in reasonable comfort.
Voltaire, who visited Blenheim Palace in the autumn of 1727, described it as 'a great mass of stone with neither charm nor taste' and thought that if the apartments 'were but as spacious as the walls thick, the house would be commodious enough'.
In the contest for the commission of Castle Howard, the untrained and untried Vanbrugh astonishingly managed to out-charm and out-clubman the professional but less socially adept Talman and to persuade the Earl of Carlisle to give the great opportunity to him instead.
As it was designed as a national monument first and a comfortable family home second, Vanbrugh had many arguments with the Duchess who wanted the Palace to be a comfortable country house for her family, ''I made Mr. Vanbrugh my enemy by the constant disputes I had with him to prevent his extravagance'' As a result of these arguments Vanbrugh resigned before the palace was completed in November 1716.
We arrive at it by a stately bridge of a single arch, and which is itself a masterpiece of architecture.
Scholars debate whether evidence of his exposure to Indian architecture can be detected in any of his architectural designs.
Downes proposes a role for an early Kit-Cat grouping in the armed invasion by William of Orange and the Glorious Revolution.
The Duchess, the formidable Sarah Churchill, particularly wanted Sir Christopher Wren.
Although Vanbrugh continued to work for the stage in many ways, he produced no more original plays.
The first baroque country house built in England was Chatsworth House, designed by William Talman three years before Castle Howard.
As with ''The Relapse'' at the outset of Vanbrugh's dramatic career, Colley Cibber again became involved, and this time he had last word.
Vanbrugh is remembered today for his vast contribution to British culture, theatre, and architecture.
It seems to have left him with a lasting distaste for the French political system but also with a taste for the comic dramatists and the architecture of France.
Blenheim Palace was conceived to be not only a grand country house, but a national monument.
His life is sharply bisected by this prison experience, which he entered at age 24 and emerged from at 29, after having spent, as Downes puts it, half his adult life in captivity.
Ironically, all of these unfounded charges derive from Blenheim&nbsp;– Vanbrugh's selection as architect of Blenheim was never completely popular.
Whether this placement and design was an ornamental feature created by Vanbrugh, or an ironic joke by Marlborough, is not known.
In May 1706 Lord Halifax and Vanbrugh—representing the octogenarian Garter King of Arms, Sir Henry St George—led a delegation to Hanover to confer the Order of the Garter on Prince George.
I have contracted a very intimate friend ship with the son of Sir John Vanbrugh, who has lately obtained a company in the foot guards, and is a young gentleman of real merit.
The steps originally had low flank walls perpendicular to the facade, which were removed in the later remodelling.
Members of that cast had to be kept from defecting to the rival actors' cooperative, had to be "seduced" (as the legal term was) back when they did defect, and had to be blandished into attending rehearsals which dragged out into ten months and brought the company to the threshold of bankruptcy.
Born in London and baptised on 24 January 1664, Vanbrugh was the fourth child (of 19), and eldest surviving son, of Giles Vanbrugh, a London cloth-merchant of Flemish-Protestant background (as evident in the name, contracted from "Van Brugh"), and his wife Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Barker (by whom Vanbrugh's mother had the first of her twenty children, Vanbrugh's elder half-sister, Elizabeth), and daughter of Sir Dudley Carleton, of Imber Court, Thames Ditton, Surrey.
Cibber, now a successful actor-manager, completed Vanbrugh's manuscript under the title of ''The Provoked Husband'' (1728) and gave it a happy and sententious ending in which the provocative wife repents and is reconciled: a eulogy of marriage which was the opposite of Vanbrugh's declared intention to end his last and belated "Restoration comedy" with marital break-up.
As an architect (or surveyor, as the term then was) Vanbrugh is thought to have had no formal training (see "Early life" above).
It had brought together the isolated and varied instances of monumental design, by, among others, Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren.
The architectural historian Kerry Downes is sceptical of earlier historians' claims of a lower middle-class background, and writes that a 19th-century suggestion that Giles Vanbrugh was a sugar-baker has been misunderstood.
Among architects, only Vanbrugh could have taken for his inspiration one of Palladio's masterpieces, and while retaining the humanist values of the building, alter and adapt it, into a unique form of baroque unseen elsewhere in Europe.
The twin columns are severe and utilitarian, and yet ornament, as they provide no structural use.
He was now bound to pay salaries to the actors and, as it turned out, to manage the theatre, a notorious tightrope act for which he had no experience.
His influence in Yorkshire can also be seen in the work of the amateur architect William Wakefield who designed several buildings in the county that show Vanbrugh's influence.
After being released from the Bastille, he had to spend three months in Paris, free to move around but unable to leave the country, and with every opportunity to see an architecture "unparalleled in England for scale, ostentation, richness, taste and sophistication".
On 29 April Edward Southwell wrote in his journal at Kings Weston "Upwards of 60 men preparing stones and digging the foundation of the new house" and on 16 June 1712 work formally began on building the new house by John Vanbrugh.His client, Edward Southwell, did not desire a house on a monumental scale.
The master craftsmen he had patronised, however, such as Grinling Gibbons, refused to work for the lower rates paid by the Marlboroughs.
There are four parapet vases.
The qualities of the building are best illustrated by the massive East Gate (''illustration, below, left''), set in the curtain wall of the service block, it has been described as resembling an impregnable entrance to a walled city.
Both have rusticated facades and similar demilune windows over a non-porticoed entrance.
This appointment was followed by a promotion to the post of Clarenceux King of Arms in March 1704.
In 1796 Uvedale Price described Blenheim as 'uniting in one building the beauty and magnificence of Grecian architecture, the picturesqueness of the Gothic, and the massive grandeur of a castle.'
Downes' example of one sugar baker's house in Liverpool, estimated to bring in £40,000 a year in trade from Barbados, throws a new light on Vanbrugh's social background, one rather different from the picture of a backstreet Chester sweetshop as painted by Leigh Hunt in 1840 and reflected in many later accounts.
Almost from the outset, funds had been intermittent.
However, Vanbrugh never mentioned this experience in writing.
Scagliola, and Corinthian columns abound, and galleries linked by soaring arches give the impression of an opera stage-set&nbsp;– doubtless the intention of the architect.
His architectural works have been described as "the architectural equivalent of the heroic play, theatrical, grandiose, a dramatic grouping of restless masses with little reference to function."
The west wing was finally completed after Vanbrugh's death, to an altered design.
The Duchess blamed Vanbrugh entirely for the growing extravagance of the palace, and its general design: that her husband and government had approved them, she discounted.
Windows were to adorn the facades, as well as light the interior.
The silhouette of the building was of equal, if not greater, importance than the interior layout.
From 1686, Vanbrugh was working undercover, playing a role in bringing about the armed invasion by William of Orange, the deposition of James II, and the Glorious Revolution of 1689.
During his almost thirty years as a practising architect, Vanbrugh designed and worked on numerous buildings.
A Grade I listed building, and formerly a RAF Boys' School, it is today divided into private apartments.
While Castle Howard is a dramatic assembly of restless masses, Blenheim is altogether of a more solid construction, relying on tall slender windows and monumental statuary on the roofs to lighten the mass of yellow stone.
Vanbrugh died "of an asthma" on 26 March 1726, in the modest town house designed by him in 1703 out of the ruins of Whitehall Palace and satirised by Swift as "the goose pie".
Vanbrugh himself never seems to have pursued those who owed him money, and throughout his life his finances can at best be described as precarious.
He was allowed to return to England in April 1693; once he returned to England he joined the Navy and took part in an unsuccessful naval attack against the French at Brest.
The likewise severe, but perfectly proportioned, garden facade has at its centre a four-columned, balcony-roofed portico.
In 1681 records name a 'John Vanbrugg' working for William Matthews, Giles Vanbrugh's cousin.
The suite of state rooms placed on the ''piano nobile'' were designed to be overpowering and magnificent displays, rather than warm, or comfortable.
Sugar refining would normally have been combined with sugar trading, which was a lucrative business.
Having burned his fingers on theatre management, Vanbrugh too extricated himself, expensively, by selling the business in 1708, though without ever collecting much of the putative price.
But as we have seen, young Vanbrugh was indeed in 1688 part of a secret network working for William's invasion.
The northeast and northwest facades of Vanbrugh's original design were entirely undecorated, and a consequent lack of popular appeal may be the reason why they were largely destroyed in later remodelling.
This play is different in tone from the largely farcical ''The Relapse'', and adapted to the greater acting skills of the rebels.
Thus what was intended as an infirmary and hostel for destitute retired sailors was transformed into a magnificent national monument.
However, Seaton Delaval was to be on a much smaller scale.
Castle Howard was acclaimed a success.
Charles Robert Cockerell had this to say about Castle Howard 'great play & charm in Hall.
"They have no company at all", reported a contemporary letter on 19 November 1696 "and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break".
In 1719, while the duchess was "not at home", Vanbrugh was able to view the palace in secret; but when he and his wife, with the Earl of Carlisle, visited the completed Blenheim as members of the viewing public in 1725, they were refused admission to even enter the park.
Vanbrugh is commemorated throughout Britain, by inns, street names, a university college (York) and schools named in his honour.
It appears that the early drawings of the design for Castle Howard were made by Hawksmoor and in 1700 he was formally introduced by Vanbrugh into the project as draughtsman and clerk of works.
The acclaim of the work at Castle Howard led to Vanbrugh's most famous commission, architect for Blenheim Palace.
Taken in this context, though he has sometimes been viewed as an odd or unqualified appointee to the College of Arms, it is not surprising, given the social expectations of his day, that by descent his credentials for his offices there were sound.
Vanbrugh's second original comedy, ''The Provoked Wife'', followed soon after, performed by the rebel actors' company.
In his architectural career, he created what came to be known as English Baroque.
His reputation has suffered because of his famed disagreements with the Duchess of Marlborough, yet, one must remember his original client was the British Nation, not the Duchess, and the nation wanted a monument and celebration of victory, and that is what Vanbrugh gave the nation.
Queen Anne paid some of them, but with growing reluctance and lapses, following her frequent altercations with her one time best friend, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough.
In the serious part of ''Love's Last Shift'', wifely patience is tried by an out-of-control Restoration rake husband, and the perfect wife is celebrated and rewarded in a climactic finale where the cheating husband kneels to her and expresses the depth of his repentance.
However, his greatest attribute was his versatility and ability to combine his talents.
On his release from prison (he was at the Bastille by then) on 22 November 1692 he spent a short time in Paris, there he would have seen much recent architecture including Les Invalides, Le Vau's Collège des Quatre-Nations and Claude Perrault's east wing of the Louvre Palace.
Consequently these houses, which often claim Vanbrugh as their architect, do not best display his own architectural concepts and ideas.
In 1719, at St Lawrence Church, York, Vanbrugh married Henrietta Maria Yarburgh of Heslington Hall, York, aged 26 to his 55.
In 1703, Vanbrugh started buying land and signing backers for the construction of a new theatre in Haymarket, designed by himself and managed by Vanbrugh along with Thomas Betterton and his associate William Congreve.
After growing up in a large household in Chester (12 children of his mother's second marriage survived infancy), the question of how Vanbrugh spent the years from age 18 to 22 (after he left school) was long unanswered, with the baseless suggestion sometimes made that he had been studying architecture in France (stated as fact in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'').
Vanbrugh was deeply distressed by the turn of events.
In 1786 Sir Joshua Reynolds wrote in his 13th Discourse '...in the buildings of Vanbrugh, who was a poet as well as an architect, there is a greater display of imagination, than we shall find perhaps in any other.'
He has shown me, not only all the designs of his father, but also two houses of his building, one near Whitehall, and the other at Greenwich.
Whilst the house and the majority of the estate buildings are still standing others have been demolished or been heavily altered.
That Vanbrugh's work at Blenheim has been the subject of criticism can largely be blamed on those, including the Duchess, who failed to understand the chief reason for its construction: to celebrate a martial triumph.
He sends new sexual temptations in the way of not only the reformed husband but also the patient wife, and allows them to react in more credible and less predictable ways than in their original context, lending the flat characters from ''Love's Last Shift'' a dimension that at least some critics are willing to consider psychological (see Hume ).
Sir John Vanbrugh's genius was of the first class; and, in point of movement, novelty and ingenuity, his works have not been exceeded by anything in modern times.
Blenheim, the largest non-royal domestic building in England, consists of three blocks, the centre containing the living and state rooms, and two flanking rectangular wings both built around a central courtyard: one contains the stables, and the other the kitchens, laundries, and storehouses.
In the hands of the ingenious artist, who knows how to polish and refine and bring them into use, we have always regarded his productions as rough jewels of inestimable value'.
In the achievement of this remit, Vanbrugh was as triumphant as was Marlborough on the field of battle.
Cibber considered this projected outcome to be "too severe for Comedy", and such severity was in fact rarely to be seen on the English stage before Ibsen.
''Laid many heavy loads on thee!''
Vanbrugh arrived in London at a time of scandal and internal drama at London's only theatre company, as a long-running conflict between pinchpenny management and disgruntled actors came to a head and the actors walked out.
Vanbrugh's introduction and advancement in the College of Arms, remain controversial.
However, it remains unknown how Vanbrugh, totally untrained and inexperienced, persuaded Earl Carlisle to grant the responsibility of architect to him.
Vanbrugh's London career was diverse and varied, comprising playwriting, architectural design, and attempts to combine these two overarching interests.
"Sugar-baker" implies wealth, as the term refers not to a maker of sweets but to the owner of a sugar house, a factory for the refining of raw sugar from Barbados.
Castle Howard, with its immense corridors in segmental colonnades leading from the main entrance block to the flanking wings, its centre crowned by a great domed tower complete with cupola, is very much in the school of classic European baroque.
In 1702, through the influence of Charles Howard, Earl of Carlisle, Vanbrugh was appointed comptroller of the Royal Works (now the Board of Works, where several of his designs may still be seen).
Ornament was almost disguised: a recess or a pillar was not placed for support, but to create a play of light or shadow.
Here the slight fluting of the stone columns seems almost excessive ornament.
He grew up in Chester, where his family had been driven by either the major outbreak of the plague in London in 1665, or the Great Fire of 1666.
A new comedy staged with the makeshift remainder of the company in January 1696, Colley Cibber's ''Love's Last Shift'', had a final scene that to Vanbrugh's critical mind demanded a sequel, and even though it was his first play he threw himself into the fray by providing it.
In the present day, ''The Relapse'', now again to be seen uncut, remains a favourite play.
Though the only decoration is the rustication on the Doric temple's pilasters, a remarkably rich effect is achieved.
Cibber, an inconspicuous young actor still employed by the parent company, seized this moment of unique demand for new plays and launched his career on two fronts by writing a play with a big, flamboyant part for himself: the Frenchified fop Sir Novelty Fashion.
The intellectual and sexually explicit Restoration comedy style was becoming less and less acceptable to audiences and was soon to be replaced by a drama of sententious morality.
It was not unusual for a merchant's son to follow in his father's trade and seek similar work in business, making use of family ties and connections.
Kings Weston House was built between 1712 and 1719 for Edward Southwell on the site of an earlier Tudor house.
Work on each of these projects overlapped with that on the next, providing a natural progression of thoughts and style.
On the southeast facade, the centre has a Doric temple front with open pediment, which surrounds the doorway.
Barry and the younger Bracegirdle had often worked together as a tragic/comic heroine pair to bring audiences the typically tragic/comic rollercoaster experience of Restoration plays.
However, as an architectural composition it is a unique example of baroque ornament.
In a trickster subplot, Vanbrugh provides the more traditional Restoration attraction of an overly well-dressed and exquisite fop, Lord Foppington, a brilliant re-creation of Cibber's Sir Novelty Fashion in ''Love's Last Shift'' (Sir Novelty has simply in ''The Relapse'' bought himself the title of "Lord Foppington" through the corrupt system of Royal title sales).
In the ''London Journal'' of 16 March 1722–23, James Boswell comments:
I could not leave it.
Two of the facades have since been remodelled, by Robert Mylne, who remodelled the interior in the 1760s.
It is possible that he attended The King's School in Chester, though no records of his being a scholar there survive.
So true it is, that genius is not confined to one subject, but wherever exercised, is equally manifest.
Perhaps to improve the view down to Avonmouth, the centre was remodelled by Mylne with a canted bay window, at odds with the tautness of Vanbrugh's overall design of the house, in which all planes were parallel or perpendicular to the walls.
His colleagues' opposition to an ill-gotten appointment ought to have been directed to Lord Carlisle, who as Deputy Earl Marshal, arranged both appointments and against whose wishes they were powerless.
Work began in 1718 and continued for ten years.
Its size and proportions led the house to be called unflatteringly by Swift, a 'goose-pie'.
Regarding the commission, William Talman, an already established architect and Comptroller of His Majesty's Works had initially been the architect of choice, charging more than the Lord had thought reasonable.
