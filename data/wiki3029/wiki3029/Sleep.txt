The study allowed 18 women and 22 men to sleep only 26 minutes per night over a four-day period.
Simultaneous collection of these measurements is called polysomnography and can be performed in a specialized sleep laboratory.
Insomnia, a dyssomnia, is a general term describing difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
Seven-year-olds are better disposed to wake up early in the morning than are fifteen-year-olds.
Although it is difficult to determine one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep.
During this stage, muscular activity as measured by EMG decreases, and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears.
The sleeping brain has been shown to remove metabolic waste products at a faster rate than during an awake state.
Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end.
Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability.
For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, sympathetic activation, and thermoregulatory changes.
Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia.
Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.
Homeostatic sleep propensity (the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode) must be balanced against the circadian element for satisfactory sleep.
An observation of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session.
Most of this awake time occurred shortly after REM sleep.
During a night's sleep, a small portion is usually spent in a waking state.
A University of California, San Diego psychiatry study of more than one million adults found that people who live the longest self-report sleeping for six to seven hours each night.
Another investigation published in ''Nutrition Research'' in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep.
Quiescence during these vulnerable hours would do the same and would be more advantageous, because the animal would still be able to respond to environmental challenges like predators, etc.
Additionally, REM deprivation results in developmental abnormalities later in life.
Proponents also suggest that REM-induced muscle inhibition in the presence of brain activation exists to allow for brain development by activating the synapses, yet without any motor consequences that may get the infant in trouble.
After 20 minutes, the mean firing rate returned rapidly toward the PRE level.
Another potential purpose for sleep could be to restore signal strength in synapses that are activated while awake to a "baseline" level, weakening unnecessary connections to better facilitate learning and memory functions again the next day.
In one study, multiple groups of human subjects were used: wake control groups and sleep test groups.
SWS is initiated in the preoptic area and consists of delta activity, high amplitude waves at less than 3.5&nbsp;Hz.
The hemisphere that is asleep, alternates so that both hemispheres can be fully rested.
White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.
The optimal amount of sleep is not a meaningful concept unless the timing of that sleep is seen in relation to an individual's circadian rhythms.
For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.
(Some people, however, can reliably wake themselves up at a specific time with no need for an alarm.)
Sleep timing is controlled by the circadian clock, sleep-wake homeostasis, and in humans, within certain bounds, willed behavior.
A 2010 review of published scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep disorders such as insomnia.
Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay awake at night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do.
In other animals the subdivision between phases of non-REM sleep is not typically used, although animal non-REM sleep can be described as lighter or deeper.
The evolution of different types of sleep patterns is influenced by a number of selective pressures, including body size, relative metabolic rate, predation, type and location of food sources, and immune function.
The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and ones that do not.
However, unlike other mammals, adult dolphins and whales are able to go without sleep for a month.
By the time infants reach the age of two, their brain size has reached 90 percent of an adult-sized brain; a majority of this brain growth has occurred during the period of life with the highest rate of sleep.
Scientists do not agree on how much sleep debt it is possible to accumulate; whether it is accumulated against an individual's average sleep or some other benchmark; nor on whether the prevalence of sleep debt among adults has changed appreciably in the industrialized world in recent decades.
Research suggests that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures.
Nocturnal and diurnal animals ''both'' have increased electrical activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night.
Amphibians have periods of inactivity but show high vigilance (receptivity to potentially threatening stimuli) in this state.
It is hypothesized that a considerable amount of sleep-related behavior, such as when and how long a person needs to sleep, is regulated by genetics.
During sleep, especially REM sleep, people tend to have dreams: elusive first-person experiences, which, despite their frequently bizarre qualities, seem realistic while in progress.
In the R&K standard, NREM sleep was divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep comprising stages 3 and 4.
When the subjects' brains were scanned during sleep, hypnograms revealed that SWS was the dominant sleep stage during the early night, representing around 23% on average for sleep stage activity.
The sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes to shut out all sunlight, and keeping computers, televisions and work materials out of the sleeping area.
In these cases, sleep may be defined using behavioral characteristics such as minimal movement, postures typical for the species, and reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.
The siesta habit has recently been associated with a 37% reduction in coronary mortality, possibly due to reduced cardiovascular stress mediated by daytime sleep.
In other words, a sleeping creature perceives fewer stimuli.
However, killer whales and some other dolphins do not sleep during the first month of life.

Human sleep occurs in periods of approximately 90 minutes, which include increasing proportions of paradoxical (REM) sleep as they repeat.
Mammals have wide diversity in sleep phenomena.
Working memory is important because it keeps information active for further processing and supports higher-level cognitive functions such as decision making, reasoning, and episodic memory.
'''Sleep''' is a naturally recurring state of mind and body characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings.
REM sleep occurs more during the low part (i.e., near body temperature minimum) of the circadian cycle, whereas slow-wave sleep occurs relatively independently of circadian time.
Generally speaking, the longer an organism is awake, the more it feels a need to sleep.
Some societies display a fragmented sleep pattern in which people sleep at all times of the day and night for shorter periods.
Preservation also does not explain why aquatic mammals sleep while moving.
Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated at the beginning and at the end of the dark time.
In terms of prevention, our findings indicate that consistently sleeping around seven hours per night is optimal for health, and a sustained reduction may predispose to ill health."
During Ramadan, many Muslims sleep during the day rather than at night.
Time zones, standard times used to unify the timing for people in the same area, correspond only approximately to the natural rising and setting of the sun.
A healthy young adult entrained to the sun will (during most of the year) fall asleep a few hours after sunset, experience body temperature minimum at 6AM, and wake up a few hours after sunrise.
However, sleep patterns vary among individual humans and even more widely among other species.
A 2014 study found that depriving mice of sleep increased cancer growth and dampened the immune system's ability to control cancers.
Humans may suffer from a number of sleep disorders.
These include dyssomnias (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea), parasomnias (such as sleepwalking and REM behavior disorder), bruxism, and the circadian rhythm sleep disorders.
This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur.
Sleep in non-human animals is observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, and, in some form, in insects and even in simpler animals such as nematodes.
Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage.
This theory fails to explain why the brain disengages from the external environment during normal sleep.
However, this does not explain why older adults still need REM sleep.
In adults, wakefulness increases, especially in later cycles.
During slow-wave sleep, humans secrete bursts of growth hormone.
The rats would then be placed in the track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.
These choices are shaped by a variety of factors, such as climate, protection from predators, housing type, technology, personal preference, and the incidence of pests.
Researchers have discovered some evidence that seems to support this assumption.
Furthermore, sleep difficulties are closely associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, alcoholism, and bipolar disorder.
Afterwards, they showed more REM sleep than usual, later named REM rebound.
Outside of a few basal animals that have no brain or a very simple one, no animals have been found to date that satisfy any of these criteria.
The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research.
Chronotype is also liable to change over the course of a person's lifetime.
The circadian rhythm influences the ideal timing of a restorative sleep episode.
Neurotransmitters, molecules whose production can be traced to specific genes, are one genetic influence on sleep which can be analyzed.
Using a combination of diffusion ionophoresis techniques pioneered by Nicholson and colleagues, in vivo 2-photon imaging, and electroencephalography to confirm the wake and sleep states, Xia and Nedergaard demonstrated that the changes in efficiency of CSF–ISF exchange between the awake and sleeping brain were caused by expansion and contraction of the extracellular space, which increased by ≈60% in the sleeping brain to promote clearance of interstitial wastes such as amyloid beta.
However it remains to be shown definitively whether any fish is capable of unihemispheric sleep.
The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean firing rate of hippocampal place cells from the PRE level.
The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds.
In sleep, metabolic rates decrease and reactive oxygen species generation is reduced allowing restorative processes to take over.
A study by A. Harvey et al.
Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake.
Fish are similar, exhibiting periods of inactivity but showing no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition.
In other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except for an intimate partner.
It has been suggested that they need to minimize energy expenditure when not hunting.
Aquatic mammal infants do not have REM sleep in infancy; REM sleep in those animals increases as they age.
He monitored this with small electrodes attached to their scalp and temples.
During late-night sleep, which entails more time spent in REM, test group performed 25% better on the procedural memory test than the control group.
Sleep duration is affected by the gene DEC2.
Circadian rhythm exerts some influence on the nighttime secretion of growth hormone.
The timing is correct when the following two circadian markers occur after the middle of the sleep episode and before awakening: maximum concentration of the hormone melatonin, and minimum core body temperature.
Reptiles have quiescent periods more similar to mammalian sleep, but do not exhibit REM or muscle atonia.
Neurological sleep states can be difficult to detect in some animals.
Dreams can seamlessly incorporate elements within a person's mind that would not normally go together.
Just like terrestrial mammals, pinnipeds that sleep on land fall into a deep sleep and both hemispheres of their brain shut down and are in full sleep mode.
It is possible that people who take siestas have different physical activity habits, e.g., waking earlier and scheduling more activity during the morning.
The stages of sleep were first described in 1937 by Alfred Lee Loomis and his coworkers, who separated the different electroencephalography (EEG) features of sleep into five levels (A to E), representing the spectrum from wakefulness to deep sleep.
Short pulses of light, at the right moment in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock.
On the final test, the average working memory span of the sleep-deprived group had dropped by 38% in comparison to the control group.
Nevertheless, Freud's research has been expanded on, especially with regard to the organization and consolidation of recent memory.
Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening is an important factor in amplifying sleep inertia.
Using sensing technologies such as EEG electrodes or accelerometers, these alarm clocks are supposed to wake people only from light sleep.
During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.
A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat proteins, and whole grains can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.
REM sleep is turned on by acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin.
This stage is characterized by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5–2&nbsp;Hz and having a peak-to-peak amplitude >75 μV.
Even if such effects of physical activity can be discounted for explaining the relationship between siestas and cardiovascular health, it is still unknown whether it is the daytime nap itself, a supine posture, or the expectancy of a nap that is the most important factor.
While awake, metabolism generates reactive oxygen species, which are damaging to cells.
In this view, REM, non-REM, and waking represent the three major modes of consciousness, neural activity, and physiological regulation.
Mammalian sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two highly distinct modes known as non-REM and REM sleep.
A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely from one end to the other.
It is likely that children are sleeping less than previously in Western societies.
During sleep, most systems in an animal are in an anabolic state, building up the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems.
Humans are also influenced by aspects of ''social time'': the hours when other people are awake, the hours when work is required, the time on the clock, etc.
One neurochemical indicator of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits many of the bodily processes associated with wakefulness.
It is theorized that sleep helps facilitate the synthesis of molecules that help repair and protect the brain from these harmful elements generated during waking.
Another study of sleep duration and mortality risk in women showed similar results.
They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.
For example, a person might only sleep with the immediate family, the extended family, a spouse or romantic partner, children, children of a certain age, children of specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all.
As the mother swims she is keeping her offspring afloat to prevent them from drowning.
The parasympathetic nervous system experiences increased activity during REM sleep which may cause erection of the penis or clitoris.
And the circadian clock has its own set of genes.
Insomnia is the most common sleep problem, with many adults reporting occasional insomnia, and 10–15% reporting a chronic condition.
Sleep debt does show some evidence of being cumulative.
A study in the ''Western Journal of Nursing Research'' in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet.
In the monotreme, REM electrical activation occurs in the brain stem, as it does in humans, but does not extend at all to the forebrain—suggesting that platypi do not dream.
Some sleep with blankets, some with pillows, some with simple headrests, some with no head support.
Sleep may be an actively social time, depending on the sleep groupings, with no constraints on noise or activity.
The quality of sleep may be evaluated from an objective and a subjective point of view.
It is well established that slow-wave sleep affects growth hormone levels in adult men.
According to the Hobson & McCarley activation-synthesis hypothesis, proposed in 1975–1977, the alternation between REM and non-REM can be explained in terms of cycling, reciprocally influential neurotransmitter systems.
After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings.
A publication by L. Xie and colleagues in 2013 explored the efficiency of the glymphatic system during sleep and provided the first direct evidence that the clearance of interstitial waste products increases during the resting state.
Subjects were given initial cognitive tests while well-rested, and then were tested again twice a day during the four days of sleep deprivation.
A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound.
(Since in quiet waking the brain is responsible for 20% of the body's energy use, this reduction has an independently noticeable impact on overall energy consumption.)
Some research shows sleep clears negative emotions.
Dreams can also be suppressed or encouraged; using anti-depressants, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or alcoholic beverages is thought to potentially suppress dreams, whereas melatonin may have the ability to encourage them.
Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals.
If sleep were not essential, one would expect to find:
File:Museo del Prado - Goya - Caprichos - No.
This allows young dolphins and whales to rest, which will help keep their immune system healthy; in turn, protecting them from illnesses.
When compared with a control group, sleep-deprived rats' blood tests indicated a 20% decrease in white blood cell count, a significant change in the immune system.
Thus, dolphins, whales, and pinnipeds (seals) engage in unihemispheric sleep while swimming, which allows one brain hemisphere to remain fully functional, while the other goes to sleep.
By the age of five or so, only slightly over two hours is spent in REM.
The organism will maneuver, as best it can, to create a thermally friendly environment—for example, by curling up into a ball if it's cold out.
Monophasic sleep occurs all at once.
Although these nonbenzodiazepine medications are generally believed to be better and safer than earlier generations of sedatives, they have still generated some controversy and discussion regarding side-effects.
A study has also been done involving direct current stimulation to the prefrontal cortex to increase the amount of slow oscillations during SWS.
The elevated firing of hippocampal place cells during SWS after spatial exploration could explain why there were elevated levels of slow-wave sleep in Datta's study, as it also dealt with a form of spatial exploration.
Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep for a few minutes at a time.
REM sleep occurs as a person returns to stage 2 or 1 from a deep sleep.
Reflexes remain fairly active.
In some societies, people sleep with at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals.
During each of these three periods, EEG data were collected for information on the rats' sleep stages.
Apneas occur when the muscles around the patient's airway relax during sleep, causing the airway to collapse and block the intake of oxygen.
The function of REM sleep is uncertain but a lack of it impairs the ability to learn complex tasks.
Rats kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia, and, eventually, fatal sepsis.
Scientists have shown numerous ways in which sleep is related to memory.
Many people regularly look at television and other screens before going to bed, a factor which may exacerbate this mass circadian disruption.
Adenosine is an ingredient in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and also a product of ATP metabolism.
Historian Roger Ekirch thinks that the traditional pattern of "segmented sleep," as it is called, began to disappear among the urban upper class in Europe in the late 17th century and the change spread over the next 200 years; by the 1920s "the idea of a first and second sleep had receded entirely from our social consciousness."
Birds do have a REM phase; they may not accumulate sleep debt; but sleep deprivation may affect their normal waking condition.
Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy, and those affected with sleep state misperception may typically report having slept only four hours despite having slept a full eight hours.
The sleeper is less responsive to the environment; many environmental stimuli no longer produce any reactions.
It is likely that sleep evolved to fulfill some primeval function and took on multiple functions over time (analogous to the larynx, which controls the passage of food and air, but descended over time to develop speech capabilities).
It follows that the evolution of monophasic sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR.
Functional paralysis from muscular atonia in REM may be necessary to protect organisms from self-damage through physically acting out scenes from the often-vivid dreams that occur during this stage.
Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day.
Sleep also influences language development.
Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.
Once the shock commenced, the rat could move to the other end of the box, ending the shock immediately.
The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction.
(EEG standards define delta waves to be from 0 to 4&nbsp;Hz, but sleep standards in both the original R&K, as well as the new 2007 AASM guidelines have a range of 0.5–2&nbsp;Hz.)
People with a certain DEC2 mutation sleep two hours less than normal.
Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep.
Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns.
Among different species, the more immature the baby is born, the more time it spends in REM sleep.
In 2004, the AASM commissioned the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R&K scoring system.
It is now possible to state that "sleep loss impairs immune function and immune challenge alters sleep," and it has been suggested that mammalian species which invest in longer sleep times are investing in the immune system, as species with the longer sleep times have higher white blood cell counts.
According to Tsoukalas (2012) REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex.
The gene also affects the sleep patterns of mice, and likely does so for all mammals.
Obstructive sleep apnea is more common than central sleep apnea.
Herbivores, who require a long waking period to gather and consume their diet, typically sleep less each day than similarly sized carnivores, who might well consume several days' supply of meat in a sitting.
John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley propose that dreams are caused by the random firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex during the REM period.
The different studies suggest that there is a correlation between sleep and the complex functions of memory.
There is a greater amount of deep sleep (stage N3) earlier in the night, while the proportion of REM sleep increases in the two cycles just before natural awakening.
The whole period normally proceeds in the order: N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM.
As measured by electroencephalography, young females are awake for 0–1% of the larger sleeping period; young males are awake for 0–2%.
