When present in adult salamanders, lungs vary greatly among different species in size and structure.
Salamanders have two types of sensory areas that respond to the chemistry of the environment.
Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places.
In the most primitive salamanders such as the Asiatic salamanders and the giant salamanders, external fertilization occurs, instead.
This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders to dwell inside rotting logs.
Most species of salamander have small teeth in both their upper and lower jaws.
Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles.
in Mexico, half are believed to have become extinct and most of the others are critically endangered.
They do not extend north of the Arctic tree line, with the northernmost Asian species, ''Salamandrella keyserlingii'' occurring in the Siberian larch forests of Sakha and the most northerly species in North America, ''Ambystoma laterale'', reaching no farther north than Labrador and ''Taricha granulosa'' not beyond the Alaska Panhandle.
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians (gymnophionans, urodeles and anurans) is a matter of debate.
Tiger salamander tadpoles in ephemeral pools sometimes resort to eating each other, and are seemingly able to target unrelated individuals.
Unfortunately, there is no large genetic pool for the species to pull from unlike in historical times.Thus there is severe concern for inbreeding due to lack of gene flow.
This action causes the ribs to puncture the body wall, each rib protruding through an orange wart arranged in a lateral row.
In a study of smaller dusky salamanders (''Desmognathus'') in the Appalachian Mountains, their diet included earthworms, flies, beetles, beetle larvae, leafhoppers, springtails, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, and mites.
Another alarming finding is the increase in abnormalities in up to 90% of the hellbender population in the Spring River (Arkansas) watershed.
''"A salamander is so cold that it puts out fire on contact.
It is avoided by birds and snakes, and can survive for up to 30 minutes after being swallowed (later being regurgitated).
Here it is held while the animal's neck is flexed, the tongue retracted and jaws closed.
Their nearest relatives are the frogs and toads, within Batrachia.
They had an exclusively Laurasian distribution until ''Bolitoglossa'' invaded South America from Central America, probably by the start of the Early Miocene, about 23 million years ago.
Granular glands scattered on the upper surface, particularly the head, back, and tail, produce repellent or toxic secretions.
In this state, an individual may retain gills or other juvenile features while attaining reproductive maturity.
The spermatophore has a packet of sperm supported on a conical gelatinous base, and often an elaborate courtship behavior is involved in its deposition and collection.
In the ''Amphiumas'', metamorphosis is incomplete, and they retain one pair of gill slits as adults, with fully functioning internal gills.
When ascending, the tail props up the rear of the body, while one hind foot moves forward and then swings to the other side to provide support as the other hind foot advances.
Neoteny, also known as paedomorphosis, has been observed in all salamander families, and may be universally possible in all salamander species.
The embryos of some terrestrial lungless salamanders, such as ''Ensatina'', that undergo direct development, have large gills that lie close to the egg's surface.
A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggested that the first divergence between these three groups took place soon after they had branched from the lobe-finned fish in the Devonian (around 360 million years ago), and before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea.
This involves tossing its head about, drawing water sharply in and out of its mouth, and snapping its jaws, all of which tend to tear and macerate the prey, which is then swallowed.
However, they have several effective lines of defense.
If the processes involved in forming new tissue can be reverse engineered into humans, it may be possible to heal injuries of the spinal cord or brain, repair damaged organs and reduce scarring and fibrosis after surgery.
In literature and legend, the salamander is associated with fire, being supposedly unharmed by the flames, while clothes made from its skins or 'wool' were believed to be incombustible.
Salamanders are opportunistic predators.
The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin and these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity.
Swallowing involves alternate contraction and relaxation of muscles in the throat, assisted by depression of the eyeballs into the roof of the mouth.
Some salamander species use tail autotomy to escape predators.
Fully terrestrial species such as the fire salamander have a flatter lens which can focus over a much wider range of distances.
Their resemblance to lizards is the result of symplesiomorphy, their common retention of the primitive tetrapod body plan, and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals.
In other species, the changes may not be triggered because of underactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid mechanism which may occur when conditions in the terrestrial environment are too inhospitable.
The mythical ruler Prester John, supposedly had a robe made from salamander hair, the "Emperor of India" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins, Pope Alexander III had a tunic which he valued highly and William Caxton (1481) wrote: ''"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre."''
The tail regrows with time, and salamanders routinely regenerate other complex tissues, including the lens or retina of the eye.
Cannibalism sometimes takes place, especially when resources are short or time is limited.
A correlation exists between the toxicity of Californian salamander species and diurnal habits: relatively harmless species like the California slender salamander (''Batrachoseps attenuatus'') are nocturnal and are eaten by snakes, while the California newt has many large poison glands in its skin, is diurnal, and is avoided by snakes.
In terrestrial species, the tail moves to counterbalance the animal as it runs, while in the arboreal salamander and other tree-climbing species, it is prehensile.
So there is still a chance that they may be able to return to their natural habitat.
Other larvae, especially in permanent pools and warmer climates, may not undergo metamorphosis until fully adult in size.
Stimulated by the alcohol, they secrete toxic mucus in defense and eventually die.
Another line of research is artificial insemination, either ''in vitro'' or by inserting spermatophores into the cloacae of females.
Some species such as the fire salamanders (''Salamandra'') are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the eggs inside her body until they hatch, either into larvae to be deposited in a water body, or into fully formed juveniles.
In temperate regions, reproduction is usually seasonal and salamanders may migrate to breeding grounds.
An opercularis muscle connects the latter to the pectoral girdle, and is kept under tension when the animal is alert.
Some females release chemical substances, possibly from the ventral cloacal gland, to attract males, but males do not seem to use pheromones for this purpose.
These may serve to warn the animal of an approaching predator.
In most cases, these are external gills, visible as tufts on either side of the head.
Various conservation initiatives are being attempted around the world.
The most profound factors are that the waters in which they are endemic are severely polluted and that even if they were found in the wild again they would be fished up for either research or exotic animal sells on the black market.
Research is being done on the environmental cues that have to be replicated before captive animals can be persuaded to breed.
Many species, such as the olm, have both lungs and gills as adults.
Of the 20 species of minute salamanders (''Thorius'' spp.)
The hind limbs are extracted and push the skin farther back, before it is eventually freed by friction as the salamander moves forward with the tail pressed against the ground.
The briefness of this period, and the speed at which radiation took place, may help to account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils that appear to be closely related to lissamphibians.
Many lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have more elaborate feeding methods.
It was said to combine hallucinogenic with aphrodisiac effects and is made by putting several live salamanders in a barrel of fermenting fruit.
Although many salamanders have cryptic colors so as to be unnoticeable, others signal their toxicity by their vivid coloring.
Later research by Slovenian anthropologist Miha Kozorog (University of Ljubljana) paints a very different picture — Salamander in brandy appears to have been traditionally seen as an adulterant, one which caused ill health.
Cave species dwelling in darkness lack pigmentation and have a translucent pink or pearlescent appearance.
# Spirits of Air - Sylphs
In the terrestrial lungless salamanders (family Plethodontidae), no lungs or gills are present, and gas exchange mostly takes place through the skin, supplemented by the tissues lining the mouth.
All types of teeth are resorbed and replaced at intervals throughout the animal's life.
Some species that lack lungs respire through gills.
This proximity is a large factor that has impacted the survival of the axolotl, as the city has expanded to take over the Xochimilco region in order to make use of its resources for water and provision and sewage.
It grabs the food item, grasps it with its teeth, and adopts a kind of inertial feeding.
Salamanders are not vocal and in most species the sexes look alike, so they use olfactory and tactile cues to identify potential mates, and sexual selection does occur.
The IUCN made further efforts in 2005 as they established the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP), which was subsequently followed by Amphibian Ark (AArk), Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG), and finally the umbrella organization known as the Amphibian Survival Alliance (ASA).
Axolotls have been used in research and have been genetically engineered so that a fluorescent protein is present in cells in the leg, enabling the cell division process to be tracked under the microscope.
The salamander's ability to regenerate lost body parts is being investigated and research is ongoing into any applications this may have for human medicine.
Stream-type larvae are more slender with short gill filaments, narrower fins and no balancers, but instead have hind limbs already developed when they hatch.
Yellow, orange, and red are the colors generally used, often with black for greater contrast.
The tadpole has three pairs of external gills, no eyelids, a long body, a laterally flattened tail with dorsal and ventral fins and in some species limb-buds or limbs.
The rough-skinned newt (''Taricha granulosa'') produces the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the most toxic nonprotein substance known.
Its skin exudes a poisonous, viscous fluid and at the same time, the newt rotates its sharply pointed ribs through an angle  between 27 and 92°, and adopts an inflated posture.
The ability to put out fire is repeated by Saint Augustine in the fifth century and Isidore of Seville in the seventh century.
The northern slimy salamander (''Plethodon glutinosus'') has a wide range and occupies a habitat similar to that of the southern gray-cheeked salamander (''Plethodon metcalfi'').
Water is drawn in through the mouth and flows out through the gill slits.
The aqueous larva emerges onto land as a terrestrial adult.
The joint formed between the bicuspid and the pedicel is partially flexible, as it can bend inward, but not outward.
The animal often then eats the resulting sloughed skin.
'''Salamanders''' are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults.
Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults.
Its mouth then gapes widely, the lower jaw remains stationary, and the tongue bulges and changes shape as it shoots forward.
The eyes of most salamanders are adapted primarily for vision at night.
To facilitate this, these salamanders have a dense network of blood vessels just under the skin and in the mouth.
Currently, the major lines of defense for the conservation of Salamanders includes both in situ and ex situ conservation methods.There are efforts in place for certain members of the Salamander family to be conserved under a conservation breeding program (CBP) but it is important to note that there should be research done ahead of time to determine if the Salamander species is actually going to value from the CBP, as researchers have noted that some species of amphibians completely fail in this environment.
At the same time, eyelids develop, the mouth becomes wider, a tongue appears, and teeth are formed.
Large species such as the Japanese giant salamander (''Andrias japonicus'') eat crabs, fish, small mammals, amphibians, and aquatic insects.
Salamanders are usually considered to have no voice and do not use sound for communication in the way frogs do; however, some species can make quiet ticking or popping noises, perhaps by the opening and closing of valves in the nose.
They also lived on the Caribbean Islands during the early Miocene epoch, confirmed by the discovery of ''Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae'''','' found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic.
In Old World newts, ''Triturus'' spp., the males are sexually dimorphic and display in front of the females.
Due to its proximity to Mexico City, officials are currently working on programs at Lake Xochimilco to bring in tourism and educate the local population on the restoration of the natural habitat of these creatures.
Most dusky salamanders (''Desmognathus'') and Pacific giant salamanders (''Dicamptodon'') lay smaller batches of medium-sized eggs in a concealed site in flowing water, and these are usually guarded by an adult, normally the female.
Some terrestrial salamanders have lungs used in respiration, although these are simple and sac-like, unlike the more complex organs found in mammals.
The gland at the base of the tail in ''Plethodon cinereus'' is used to mark fecal pellets to proclaim territorial ownership.
Unique among vertebrates, they are capable of regenerating lost limbs, as well as other damaged parts of their bodies.
Many salamanders have patches of teeth attached to the vomer and the palatine bones in the roof of the mouth, and these help to retain prey.
However, the axolotl has the benefit of being raised in farms for the purpose of research facilities.
Some aquatic species, such as sirens and amphiumas, have reduced or absent hind limbs, giving them an eel-like appearance, but in most species, the front and rear limbs are about the same length and project sidewards, barely raising the trunk off the ground.
Legends have developed around the salamander over the centuries, many related to fire.
This may provide an aposematic signal that makes the spines more visible.
The salamander was said to be so toxic that by twining around a tree, it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well, could kill all who drank from it.
The results of this research may be used in captive-breeding programmes for endangered species.
Large or resistant prey is retained by the teeth while repeated protrusions and retractions of the tongue draw it in.
It seems that after the loss of a limb, cells draw together to form a clump known as a blastema.
The protruded tongue has a central depression, and the rim of this collapses inward as the target is struck, trapping the prey in a mucus-laden trough.
The larvae of tiger salamanders (''Ambystoma tigrinum''), for example, develop limbs soon after hatching and in seasonal pools promptly undergo metamorphosis.
Salamanders have thin skins and soft bodies, and move rather slowly, and at first sight might appear to be vulnerable to opportunistic predation.
In Hermetic teachings, there are four orders of elements and each has a ruling elemental over it:
In salamanders, this occurs over a short period of time and involves the closing of the gill slits and the loss of structures such as gills and tail fins that are not required as adults.
Here, vegetation zones and proximity to water are of greater importance than altitude.
Other species exhibit similar mimicry.
Unlike frogs, even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth.
It has highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a skin shedding process controlled by hormones from the pituitary and thyroid glands.
In these species, the male releases sperm onto the egg mass in a reproductive process similar to that of typical frogs.
Both seem to have appeared before the end of the Jurassic, the former being exemplified by ''Chunerpeton tianyiensis'', ''Pangerpeton sinensis'', ''Jeholotriton paradoxus'', ''Regalerpeton weichangensis'', ''Liaoxitriton daohugouensis'' and ''Iridotriton hechti'', and the latter by ''Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis''.
The sacrifice of the tail may be a worthwhile strategy, if the salamander escapes with its life and the predator learns to avoid that species of salamander in future.
The red salamander (''Pseudotriton ruber'') is a palatable species with a similar coloring to the red eft.
Salamanders range in size from the minute salamanders, with a total length of , including the tail, to the Chinese giant salamander which reaches  and weighs up to .
These extended areas seem to be associated with the identification of prey items, the recognition of conspecifics, and the identification of individuals.
The position of the Sirenidae is disputed; the position shown is considered by Naish to explain the data best.
Specific reasons for the decline may include climate change, chytridiomycosis, or volcanic activity, but the main threat is habitat destruction as logging, agricultural activities, and human settlement reduce their often tiny, fragmented ranges.
To find their prey, salamanders use trichromatic color vision extending into the ultraviolet range, based on three photoreceptor types that are maximally sensitive around 450, 500, and 570&nbsp;nm.
''Karaurus sharovi'' from the Upper Jurassic of Kazakhstan resembled modern mole salamanders in morphology and probably had a similar burrowing lifestyle.
The Japanese giant salamander has been the subject of legend and artwork in Japan, in the ''ukiyo-e'' work by Utagawa Kuniyoshi.
It is a safe and non-invasive method that requires the collection of the spermatophores and places them into a deep freeze for preservation.
The opercularis system consists of two ossicles: the columella (equivalent to the stapes of higher vertebrates) which is fused to the skull, and the operculum.
The changes that take place at metamorphosis are under the control of thyroid hormones and in obligate neotenes such as the axolotl (''Ambystoma mexicanum''), the tissues are seemingly unresponsive to the hormones.
The hellbender is another large, long-lived species with dwindling numbers and fewer juveniles reaching maturity than previously.
In aquatic, cold-water species like the southern torrent salamander (''Rhyacotriton variegatus''), the lungs are very small with smooth walls, while species living in warm water with little dissolved oxygen, such as the lesser siren (''Siren intermedia''), have large lungs with convoluted surfaces.
The well-known Japanese mythological creature known as the ''kappa'' may be inspired by this salamander.
They may function to speed up the mating process, reducing the risk of its being disrupted by a predator or rival male.
When the danger has passed, the ribs retract and the skin heals.
Salamanders split off from the other amphibians during the mid- to late Permian, and initially were similar to modern members of the Cryptobranchoidea.
As of 2013, it is a method that is being used to save not only the axolotl but also numerous other members of the salamander family.
They feed on algae and other soft-plants in the wild, and easily eat offered lettuce.
Predators that previously fed on it have been shown to avoid it after encountering red efts, an example of Batesian mimicry.
The crown, which has two cusps (bicuspid), is attached to a pedicel by collagenous fibers.
Often, these are on the tail, which may be waggled or turned up and arched over the animal's back.
# Spirits of Fire - Salamanders
Unlike frogs, an adult salamander is able to regenerate limbs and its tail when these are lost.
In California, the palatable yellow-eyed salamander (''Ensatina eschscholtzii'') closely resembles the toxic California newt (''Taricha torosa'') and the rough-skinned newt (''Taricha granulosa''), whereas in other parts of its range, it is cryptically colored.
The earliest known salamander fossils have been found in geological deposits in China and Kazakhstan, dated to the middle Jurassic period around 164 million years ago.
The tadpoles are carnivorous and the larval stage may last from days to years, depending on species.
The tail drops off and wriggles around for a while after an attack, and the salamander either runs away or stays still enough not to be noticed while the predator is distracted.
In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and mammals were all found to be susceptible.
Survey work is being undertaken to assess the status of these salamanders, and to better understand the factors involved in their population declines, with a view to taking action.
The skin lacks scales and is moist and smooth to the touch, except in newts of the Salamandridae, which may have velvety or warty skin, wet to the touch.
Researchers from the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute have found that when macrophages were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and instead formed scar tissue.
Many of the tropical climbing salamanders (''Bolitoglossa'') and lungless salamanders (Plethodontinae) lay a small number of large eggs on land in a well-hidden spot, where they are also guarded by the mother.
The red eft, the brightly colored terrestrial juvenile form of the eastern newt (''Notophthalmus viridescens''), is highly poisonous.
Common species such as the tiger salamander and the mudpuppy are being given hormones to stimulate the production of sperm and eggs, and the role of arginine vasotocin in courtship behaviour is being investigated.
Mucus coating on damp skin makes them difficult to grasp, and the slimy coating may have an offensive taste or be toxic.
# Spirits of Water - Undines
The fire salamander (''Salamandra salamandra'') has a ridge of large granular glands down its spine which are able to squirt a fine jet of toxic fluid at its attacker.
In plethodonts, the sensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organs extends to the nasolabial grooves, which stretch from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth.
Vocalization in salamanders has been little studied and the purpose of these sounds is presumed to be the startling of predators.
Males usually arrive first and in some instances set up territories.
Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of a limb, a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure.
Although larval teeth are shaped like pointed cones, the teeth of adults are adapted to enable them to readily grasp prey.
They are generally not restricted to specific foods, but feed on almost any organism of a reasonable size.
Climate change has also immensely affected axolotls and their populations throughout the southern Mexico area.
It is only the  cells from just beneath the surface of the skin that are pluripotent and able to develop into any type of cell.
An environmental education programme is being undertaken to encourage sustainable management of wild populations in the Qinling Mountains and captive breeding programmes have been set up.
When placed into a fire, the salamander would attempt to escape from the log, lending to the belief that salamanders were created from flames.
Sometimes this stage is completely bypassed, and the eggs of most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) develop directly into miniature versions of the adult without an intervening larval stage.
Once inside the cloaca, the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca, one or more chambers in the roof of the cloaca, where they are stored for sometimes lengthy periods until the eggs are laid.
The Chinese giant salamander, at 1.8&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) the largest amphibian in the world, is critically endangered, as it is collected for food and for use in traditional Chinese medicine.
However, few data have been gathered on population sizes over the years, and by intensive surveying of historic and suitable new locations, it has been possible to locate individuals of other species such as ''Parvimolge townsendi'', which had been thought to be extinct.
Genetics may also play a part.
A general decline in living amphibian species has been linked with the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.
They looked superficially like robust modern salamanders but lacked a number of anatomical features that developed later.
The arboreal salamander can squeak using a different mechanism; it retracts its eyes into its head, forcing air out of its mouth.
Salamanders do not have claws, and the shape of the foot varies according to the animal's habitat.
One-third of the known salamander species are found in North America.
Habitat loss, silting of streams, pollution and disease have all been implicated in the decline and a captive breeding programme at Saint Louis Zoo has been successfully established.
Visual cues are also thought to be important in some ''Plethodont'' species.
Respiration differs among the different species of salamanders, and can involve gills, lungs, skin, and the membranes of mouth and throat.
# Spirits of Earth - Gnomes
There are about 655 living species of salamander.
has plate-like webbed feet which adhere to smooth surfaces by suction, while the rock-climbing ''Hydromantes'' species from California have feet with fleshy webs and short digits and use their tails as an extra limb.
A higher proportion of salamander species than of frogs or caecilians are in one of the at-risk categories established by the IUCN.
This superficially appears undifferentiated, but cells that originated in the skin later develop into new skin, muscle cells into new muscle and cartilage cells into new cartilage.
The latter is restricted to the slightly cooler and wetter conditions in north-facing cove forests in the southern Appalachians, and to higher elevations above 900 m (3,000&nbsp;ft) while the former is more adaptable, and would be perfectly able to inhabit these locations, but some unknown factor seems to prevent the two species from co-existing.
Males are sometimes to be seen investigating potential mates with their snouts.
A newt plays a key role in Roald Dahl's children's book ''Matilda'' when, in the chapter 'The First Miracle', the eponymous heroine Matilda Wormwood slips a newt into the headmistress Miss Trunchbull's water, and tips it over by telekinesis.
The ensatina salamander occasionally makes a hissing sound, while the sirens sometimes produce quiet clicks, and can resort to faint shrieks if attacked.
When the front limbs have been worked clear, a series of body ripples pushes the skin towards the rear.
Pheromones play an important part in the process and may be produced by the abdominal gland in males and by the cloacal glands and skin in both sexes.
Most, however, are between  in length.
''Ambystoma'' and ''Taricha'' spp.
The system seems able to detect low-frequency vibrations (500–600&nbsp;Hz) which may be picked up from the ground by the fore limbs and transmitted to the inner ear.
The tree-climbing salamander (''Bolitoglossa'' sp.)
