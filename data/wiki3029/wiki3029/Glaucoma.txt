Risk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity.
This newer procedure, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), uses a 532-nm, frequency-doubled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, which selectively targets melanin pigment in the trabecular meshwork cells.
Positive family history is a risk factor for glaucoma.
Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women.
Thickness of the nerve fiber layer
The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance.
Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma.
These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure.
The frequency doubling illusion can also be used to detect glaucoma with the use of a frequency doubling technology perimeter.
This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient.
It is a temporary solution, not a cure.
Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain.
In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called "acute" angle closure).
If treated early it is possible to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery.
In open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, depending on the method of estimation used.
Uveitic Glaucoma is due to uveitis, the swelling and inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye.
How it is accomplished
* Miotic agents (parasympathomimetics), such as pilocarpine, work by contraction of the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (also, ''primary glaucoma'', ''chronic glaucoma'') refers to slow clogging of the drainage canals resulting in increased eye pressure which causes progressive optic nerve damage.
Normal tension glaucoma (also ''NTG'', ''low tension glaucoma'', ''normal pressure glaucoma'') is a condition where the optic nerve is damaged although intraocular pressure (IOP) is in the normal range (12-22mm Hg).
About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor.
Valving procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.
Laser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO2 laser system.
Neovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage.
In addition, SLT may be repeated three to four times, whereas ALT can usually be repeated only once.
The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage and nerve damage, and preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients, with minimal side effects.
A newer type of laser trabeculoplasty uses a "cold" (nonthermal) laser to stimulate drainage in the trabecular meshwork.
The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and/or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).
These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow.
Studies in the 1970s reported that the use of cannabis may lower intraocular pressure.
inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.
Collagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.
Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil.
Secondary glaucoma refers to any case in which another disease, trauma, drug or procedure causes increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss, and may be mild or severe.
The mean intraocular pressure for both groups were similar.
Absolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma.
The examiner places a pachymeter gently on the front of the eye to measure its thickness.
The United States Preventive Services Task Force as of 2013 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma.
Early surgical techniques like iridectomy and fistulating methods have recently been supplemented by less invasive procedures like small implants, a range of options now widely called MIGS (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery).
Professor Anthony Molteno developed the first glaucoma drainage implant, in Cape Town in 1966.
Scarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether.
Vascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.
This is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for 90% of cases in the United States, but fewer in Asian countries.
Both internationally and in the United States glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness.
Open-angle glaucoma accounts for 90% of glaucoma cases in the United States.
In angle closure glaucoma (also ''closed angle glaucoma'', ''primary angle closure glaucoma'', ''acute glaucoma'') the iris bows forward and causes physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn blocks outflow of the aqueous humor from within the eye.
The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.
No clear evidence indicates vitamin deficiencies cause glaucoma in humans.
Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach .
Globally cataracts are a more common cause.
Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss.
The examiner then uses a tonometer to measure the inner pressure of the eye through pressure applied by a puff of warm air or a tiny tool.
Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma.
Associated factors include inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, including cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures.
Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.
Angle closure-induced ocular hypertension and glaucomatous optic neuropathy may also occur with these anomalies, and has been modelled in mice.

Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists.
The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905.
Intraocular pressure is a function of production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork.
In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork.
The underlying cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear.
The word "glaucoma" is from ancient Greek ''glaukos'' which means blue, green, or gray.
The ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through.
Glaucoma is also the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open angle glaucoma.
Individuals with a family history of NTG, those of Japanese ancestry, and those with a history of systemic heart disease are at higher than average risk of developing NTG.
Increased eye pressure in uveitis can result from the inflammation itself or from the steroids used to treat it.
The inconsistent relationship of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with increased intraocular pressure has provoked hypotheses and studies on anatomic structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell/axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.
Acute angle closure is an emergency.
In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply - often associated with low or irregular blood pressure - to the retina and optic nerve head.
Several theories exist on its exact etiology.
Rho kinase inhibitors, such as ripasudil, work by inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the morphological changes in the trabecular meshwork and increased aqueous outflow.
'''Neovascular glaucoma''', an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

The increased pressure is caused by trabecular blockage.
Eyedrops are used to numb the eye.
This is associated with increased pressure in the eye.
Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four patients who had toxic glaucoma.
However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage.
The same year, there were 2.8 million people in the United States with open angle glaucoma.
Examination for glaucoma also could be assessed with more attention given to sex, race, history of drug use, refraction, inheritance and family history.
The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea.
In English, the word was used as early as 1587 but did not become commonly used until after 1850, when the development of the ophthalmoscope allowed people to see the optic nerve damage.
Long-term results are not available.
blue, green, light gray).
Using a small magnification device with a light on the end, the examiner can examine the magnified optic nerve.
Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma.
Not all people with primary open-angle glaucoma have eye pressure that is elevated beyond normal, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression even in these cases.

One of them underwent phacoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops.
Studies show SLT is as effective as ALT at lowering eye pressure.
Onset is slow and painless, and loss of vision is gradual and irreversible.
Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.
The most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy.
The patient looks straight ahead and is asked to indicate when light passes the patient's peripheral field of vision.
The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma.
A thicker-than-average cornea can result in a pressure reading higher than the 'true' pressure whereas a thinner-than-average cornea can produce a pressure reading lower than the 'true' pressure.
further closure of trabecular meshwork, which is responsible for absorption of aqueous humor).
Other factors can cause glaucoma, known as "secondary glaucoma", including prolonged use of steroids (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict blood flow to the eye, such as severe diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); ocular trauma (angle-recession glaucoma); and uveitis (uveitic glaucoma).
Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork.
Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.
Glaucoma has been classified into specific types:
The primary division in categorizing different types of glaucoma is open-angle and closed angle (or angle closure) glaucoma.

The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina.
Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency.
The first drug to reduce IOP, pilocarpine, was introduced in the 1870s.
Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several genes (including ''MYOC, ASB10, WDR36, NTF4'', and ''TBK1'' genes), although most cases of glaucoma do not involve these genetic mutations.
Furthermore, no scientific evidence has been found that demonstrates increased benefits and/or diminished risks of cannabis use to treat glaucoma compared with the wide variety of pharmaceutical agents now available.
is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma.
'''Glaucoma''' is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss.
Occasionally, failure of the normal third-trimester gestational atrophy of the hyaloid canal and the tunica vasculosa lentis is associated with other anomalies.
Perimetry (visual field test)
Owing to the sensitivity of all methods of tonometry to corneal thickness, methods such as Goldmann tonometry should be augmented with pachymetry to measure the central corneal thickness (CCT).
'''Toxic glaucoma''' is open angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis.
The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent, contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork.
* Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine and apraclonidine, work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.
The disease affects about two million people in the United States.
This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and pain.
Many people of East Asian descent are prone to developing angle closure glaucoma due to shallower anterior chamber depths, with the majority of cases of glaucoma in this population consisting of some form of angle closure.
The possible neuroprotective effects of various topical and systemic medications are also being investigated.
A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available.
In an effort to determine whether marijuana, or drugs derived from it, might be effective as a glaucoma treatment, the US National Eye Institute supported research studies from 1978 to 1984.
Prior to the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.
'''Primary open-angle glaucoma''' is when optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of the visual field.
In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights.
This allows the examiner to map the patient’s field of vision.
Echothiophate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used in chronic glaucoma.
NPDS is demonstrated to cause significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy.
This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant, or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.
It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in ischemia of the retina or ciliary body.
This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.
The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.
In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases.
In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal angle is completely closed because of forward displacement of the final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in the inability of the aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber and then out of the trabecular network.
The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure.
The association of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and the eye disease glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Bannister in 1622: "...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...".
In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively "scars").
Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.
Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.
Primary juvenile glaucoma is a neonate or juvenile abnormality where ocular hypertension is evident at birth or shortly thereafter and is caused by abnormalities in the anterior chamber angle development that blocks the outflow of the aqueous humor.
Eyes described as γλαυκóς due to disease might have had a gray cataract in the Hippocratic era, or, in the early Common Era, the greenish pupillary hue sometimes seen in angle-closure glaucoma.
* Prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost, increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor.
From here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via Schlemm's canal into scleral plexuses and general blood circulation.
Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy.
Adherence to medication protocol can be confusing and expensive; if side effects occur, the patient must be willing either to tolerate them or to communicate with the treating physician to improve the drug regimen.
The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved.
* Topical beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as timolol, levobunolol,  and betaxolol, decrease aqueous humor production by the epithelium of the ciliary body.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of Aqueous humor.
And for glaucomatous painful blind eye and some cases of glaucoma, cyclocryotherapy for ciliary body ablation could be considered to be performed.
Tends to occur in the far-sighted, who have smaller than normal anterior chambers, making the physical contact more likely.
Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.
Complete field of vision
The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.
Those at risk are advised to have a dilated eye examination at least once a year.
*The first-generation Molteno and other nonvalved implants sometimes require the ligation of the tube until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight.
Because pressure measurement error can be caused by more than just CCT (i.e., corneal hydration, elastic properties, etc.
Currently, there are no high-quality controlled trials demonstrating a beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatments in lowering IOP in people with neovascular glaucoma.
Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain.
More compounds in this class are being investigated in phase 2 and phase 3 trials.
Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways.
Glaucoma has been called the "silent thief of sight" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time.
In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed with a variety of biocompatible spacer or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick, ologen Collagen Matrix, or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.
The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.
These studies demonstrated some derivatives of marijuana lowered intraocular pressure when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye.
It occurs more commonly among older people.
Severe pain is present in the eye.

The cause of NTG is unknown.
In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.
In 2012 the American Glaucoma Society published a position paper discrediting the use of cannabis as a legitimate treatment for elevated intraocular pressure, for reasons including short duration of action and side effects that limit many activities of daily living.
About eleven to sixty-seven million people have glaucoma globally.
The open angle refers to the angle where the iris meets the cornea being as wide and open as it should be, allowing the fluid from inside the eye to drain, thus relieving the internal pressure.
Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly.
Treatment depends on whether it is open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma.
Pigmentary glaucoma (also, pigmentary dispersion syndrome) is caused by pigment cells sloughing off from the back of the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor.
Where this angle is narrowed or closed, pressure can build up, and eventually damage the optic nerve leading to loss of vision.
Unlike open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma is a result of the angle between the iris and cornea closing.
A rare condition, it occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, most nearsighted.
This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery.
Various rare congenital/genetic eye malformations are associated with glaucoma.
It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids.
Normal-tension glaucoma, which comprises one-third of POAG, is also associated with genetic mutations (including ''OPA1'' and ''OPTN'' genes).
